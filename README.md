This is a project created for SoftUni by Dean Yordanov
The project included the following:
Converting a free licensed HTML/CSS/JS Template into a working WodrPress Theme
The template I have chosen turned out to be a somehow funny in terms of CSS and a lot have been changed from the initial design.

Creating a Plugin with multiple functionalities including a custom post type (Brands) Options for the plugin located within the Admin Area > Settings > JOH Settings
Plugin should have AJAX functionality included and it should use a shortcode.

In order to diplay the Brands custom post type a page should be created with the shortcode [diplay_brands]
This could later be added to the primary menu or any other menu using the Archive > Brands setting.
The plugin is modifying automatically the title of the page and comes with a template for it in order to present you a Brands Clicking Game.

I have had a lot of fun with the AJAX functionality and while it is simple I hope you enjoy it. Who will win?
